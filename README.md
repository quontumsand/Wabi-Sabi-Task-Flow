# Wabi-Sabi Task Flow

A minimalist, offline-first task flow app inspired by *wabi-sabi* — simplicity, imperfection, and steady progress.

This is **v0**, intentionally lightweight and self-contained:
- Single HTML file
- No backend
- No accounts
- No tracking
- No build step required

Just open it and work.

## ✨ Features

- Export tasks as JSON for backup or migration

## 🧠 Philosophy

Wabi-Sabi Task Flow is designed to:
- Reduce friction
- Avoid over-structuring work
- Encourage presence over productivity theater

This project favors **clarity over complexity** and **flow over optimization**.

---

## 📦 Project Status

- **v0**: Static, offline-first HTML app
- Future versions may add optional enhancements (calendar sync, app packaging, modular architecture)
- Core goal: keep the base experience simple and usable without servers

---

## 🛠️ Tech Notes

- React + Babel loaded via CDN (no build tools required)
- Tailwind via CDN
- Data stored locally in the browser

This approach is intentional for v0.
